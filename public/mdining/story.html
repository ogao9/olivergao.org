				Chicken tenders on my thighs. <br />

				Garlic bread is in my head. <br />

				Please explore our data now.

				We analyzed data documenting the meal swipes of students at each
				dining hall along with the food items that were served. Read on
				to take a deeper dive into the dining halls through a series of
				interactive data visualizations.
			</p>
			<p>
				We found that out of all the meals, the top items served for
				breakfast are the most similar across all dining halls. You can
				always count on Oatmeal and Scrambled Eggs being served during
				breakfast at all seven dining halls. The dining halls begin to
				show some character at lunch as the top items served begin to
				vary. South Quad and Mosher-Jordan serve Sandwiches Made to
				Order the most. Markley and North Quad offer a steady sweet
				treat, serving Chocolate Chunk Cookies almost every day. Bursley
				and East Quad are on the cheese squad, regularly serving the duo
				of Cheese Bread and Cheese Pizza.

				We know you’ve been waiting for those Chicken Tenders all week.
				There’s a good chance your local dining hall will be serving
				them on Friday. Don’t sleep on Twigs at
				Oxford though. It might be small, but it can pump out Chicken
				Tenders like nobody’s business on Fridays.

				Are you vegetarian? Don’t worry, we didn’t forget about you.
				Lucky for you, Scrambled Tofu is served everywhere on Sundays.

				Do you want us to let you in on a little secret? If you ever
				want to just eat a meal in peace and avoid the crowds, go to
				South Quad, Bursley, or Mosher-Jordan anytime from 3-4 PM on a
				weekday. Who knows? You might even have a chance at getting a
				whole table to yourself.
